	desc = "An unorthodox and somewhat dated Single Action Revolver that is incompatible with speedloaders as it lacks a swing-out cylinder. \
	Has a longer firing interval than regular revolvers due to needing to cock the hammer after every shot. \
	The simplistic design allows for tighter tolerances between the cylinder and barrel, causing less gasses to escape during firing and increasing muzzle velocity."
