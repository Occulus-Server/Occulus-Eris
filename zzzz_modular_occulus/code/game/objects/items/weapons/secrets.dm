As far as our analysis can tell, while the code of the Hivemind refers to Mekhane, it is unlikely that the Church had a hand in its creation, given the limited scope of their equipment on the ship. I have asked EES to pay close attention and notify me of any anomalous power readings from the Church. Better safe than sorry.

	I have no idea what you're expecting out of our lads. You haven't paid us for our last go at a spraydown.

We aren't allowed to buy any more, and we're supposed to get rid of all of it by the end of 2425. Just to warn you, it's strong stuff.
