The assigned supervisor of the vast rusting hulk that is the CEV Northern Light. At least, as long as you keep sending the expedition reports.<br>\
This ship is a pinnacle of your career, crewed by an alliance of corporations and factions that must cooperate to survive.<br>\

You are the leader of this ship. Your word is law, but only as long as you can enforce that law.<br>\
Your command staff are comprised the leaders from each faction. They have their own agendas, and their interests must be served too. If you make them unhappy, the loyalty of their faction goes with them.<br>\
Treat your command officers with respect, and listen to their council. Try not to micromanage their departments or interfere in their affairs, and they should serve you well<br>\

You are a free agent, able to go where you will. Your loyalty given to whoever you see fit. You cannot run this ship alone, however. You need everyone."

	Your third loyalty is to your command staff. They represent their entire faction while on-duty. Listen to their counsel. Ensure their interests are served. Keep them happy"
